DATA STORY:

Overview Monthly Revenue breakdown from 2017-08/2018
      *Due to after lanuching there was not much signicant sale in 2016, even no sale in 11 & 12/2016. Thus, only collect data from 01/2017 to 08/2018 which already remove order has status cancelled and unvailable.

      *During operation time, there was emerging growth 5 times after 8 months. After that there was a slightly drop but the monthly Revenue is around 8 Millions and above.
      *Comparing 2017 VS 2018, we experience that from May to August has pattern of low sale season and gradually grown before hitting in last 3 months of the year.


With the emerging growth trend of platform, we explore a few elements which might contribute to the sucess.
      *Delivery processing leadtime is one of elements to platform's sucess. Since the time meet to customers expectation.

      *Overall, the late delivery compare to customer expectation is at 7% compare to On-time delivery. This could be a reason while this Ecoomerce perfomance well in Brazil for a short time. They was able provide an excellent delivery service within leadtime as promised to customers.

      *However, from 2017-11 to 2018-03 there was an inreasing of late delivery and also during these peak sale season of the year.

      *After 2018-03, the late delivery had declined but extremly but compare to last year 2017 still higher.

      *Inclusion, maybe we should have an optimise process to improve the delivery leadtime since Revenue showed decline trend after 2018-05.

      *By reviewing on internal order process we found that #79% shipping trễ hơn thời gian limit cho phép & #100% lỗi đơn trễ là do shipping time cao hơn thời gian cho phép



Another element contribute to customer satisfaction is payment method variety.
        *Credit card is the number 1 choice for payment type on platform and this reflect that Brazil customers enjoy consuming on credit. 
        *Boleto and debit card are both online cash payment method but boleto payment tyoe is one fifth compare to credit card and much more selected by customers compared to debit card.
        *While voucher is also one of the options for consumer to enjoy shopping online.
        *Most of credit card type has function offer installment and 62% Revenue was contributed from Installment payment this can be an USP for platform to offer to customer 0% interest rate this can increase average order value per transaction.



With payment installment is most popular payment option in Brazil, especially on the platform. We explore that if we offer 0% interest rate, average orer value could increase.
      * MOST Revenue contribute by 12 MONTH payment term, then 6 months and 3 months. 24 months is a small amount. However, population of 3 months is highest, second player is 6 months then 12 months.
